URGENT:  Lectures goes on-line

Dear VIP-student. In the light of the recent CoVid-development, I (not KU) have decided that the remaining two lectures this year in VIP will be purely online.  NO PHYSICAL LECTURES. It will be boring, but much safer.

Please note that the TA-session Wednesday 15/12 still is physical.

I will try to recod the lectures and make the videos available on Absalon, but no guarantee.  Since assignment 4 will buid heavily on the lecture Wednesday 15/12,
I strongly recommend to attend to the on-line lecture.

For questions during the on-lin lectures, please interupt oraly and do not use neither the chat function nor the raised hand function- I simply cannot have focus two places at the same time. I recommend turning you camera on when asking questions. Please notice that if you ask questions, your voice (and image) will appear on the recording.
If you, because of GDPR, don't want this, please ask your question to your TA or mail me.

The lecture Monday 3/1-2022 (and following lectures) may be held on-line as well. However, this has not been decided yet. Information about this will be posted at Absalon a few days before (ie. about 31/12).

For the TA-session 15/12, please take the usual precausions: disindect hands, keep dispance to all but the few ones that you work closely together with etc.
