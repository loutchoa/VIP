\noindent 
This is the third mandatory assignment on the course Vision
and Image Processing. The goal for you is to get familiar with
dense stereo matching for disparity computation.
\bigskip

{\bf This assignment must be solved in groups}. We expect that you will
form small groups of 2 to 4 students that will work on this assignment.
You have to pass this and the other 3 mandatory assignments in
order to pass the course.   If you do not pass this assignment, but you
have made a SERIOUS attempt, you will get a second chance of
submitting a new solution. 
\bigskip

{\bf The deadline for this assignment is Monday 8/1, 2018 at 20:00}. 
You must submit your solution electronically via the Absalon home
page. For general information on relevant software, requirement to the form
of your solution including the maximal page limit, how to upload on
Absalon etc, please see the first assignment.


\section*{Stereo}
The goal of this assignment is to implement and test a traditional
dense algorithm for stereo correspondence analysis.  You may assume
that the stereo image pairs show richly textured piecewise smooth
surfaces with Lambertian reflectance properties and that the images are
rectified, i.e. corresponding point have the same vertical coordinate
value. In this assignment you are not supposed to compute depth, but
only disparities, i.e. the difference in horizontal coordinate. 
\medskip

Some images (see later) may be in color and some in gray. You are
welcome to base your matching procedure on color information or to
attribute each pixels with a longer vector of feature values
(e.g. obtained by local filtering). You may also stick to intensity
matching. Color conversion from RGB to luminance Y may be done using   
$Y \;=\; 0.3*R + 0.59*G + 0.11*B$.  
\medskip

You may find that descriptive strength of intensity indormation is
limited (and may not always single out the correct matches).  One
approach to reduce the number of false matches is to apply
two-way matching and only to accept candidate matches that agree. 
Another approach is to require that the best match candidate is much
better than the second best candidate.
\medskip

Despite the techniques described above, pixel comparisons are not
sufficieltly descriptive for solving the correspondence problem.  In
this assigment you should compute the data term (measuring the
degree of intensity agreement) by normalized cross correlation. You
should vary the size of the window, say from 5x5 over 7x7 to 11x11,
and report what you think is the optimal size. 
\medskip

You will need to apply the knowledge that the scene surface is
piecewise smooth.  This implies that the disparity surface will be
piecewise smooth. Thus, you may estimate the disparity gradient
magnitude and prefer solutions that keep this small most places. You
may then encounter a situation whith two matching possibilities: The
first candidate solution has a small data term (intensities agree) but
results in a large disparity gradient, the second possibility is just
the opposite, having a small smoothness term.  You have to weight the
data term and the continuity term together in one way or another to
select the best match.  
\medskip

To handle numerically large disparities a coarse-to-fine approach
using  a (truncated) factor-2 pyramid representation of the images
should be applied. Here, each image in the pyramid is subsampled with
a factor of 2 (along each dimension) from the next larger image. The
disparity magnitude will be reduced with the same factor. Thus, the
disparity will be numerically small at the topmost pyramid level and 
a small search area (of $\pm M$) will suffice.
\medskip

Having estimated the disparity at the top pyramid level you may
upsample the reconstructed disparity image to the size of the images
at the pyramid level just below and double the disparity values. This
gives you a prior for the disparity at this pyramid level and makes
possible to keep the search constantly small (e.g. $\pm M$).  
\medskip

Repeating the above procedure iteratively down through the pyramid
levels you may finally obtain matches at the ground pyramid level and
reconstruct a dense disparity surface at the original image
resolution. In this assignment you are  advised to keep the number of
pyramid levels fixed to say 4. This will make it possible to register
disparity values as large as $D_{\mbox{max}} \;=\; M \cdot (2^4 -1) = 15M$ 
using a constant small search area of $\pm M$ pixels. Please note that
in some images you may know that the disparity always will be negative
while in other images it may (due to cropping) be both positive and
negative. 
\medskip

Several images show scene with depth discontinuities.  We recommed
that you do {\bf not} detect discontinuities. However, partial visible
(occluded) areas cling to discontinuities, and it might show
advantageous to represent register such pixels explicitly. Occluded
pixels have no match and appears together.  Thus one possibility is to
mark pixels as occluded if the mean (or median) of the data term in a
3x3 window is sufficiently large.   
\medskip

You are most welcome to compare your method with stereo algorithms
available on the internet or as OpenCV-implementation, but using such
implementations only will not be considered a solution to this
assignment. 
\medskip

To sum up, you should implement and test your own algorithm for
solving the stereo correspondence problem using normalized cross
correlation in a pyramid representation of the images. To enforce
smoothness correspondences resulting in a large disparity gradient
should be avoided. Two-way matching, explicit occlusion detection
etc. may by exploited to limit the number of false matching. The
required amount of experiments and documentation is described below. 





\section{Testing}
To validate and document your program you should use the images
{\em Tsubuka}, {\em Venus} and {\em Map} from the 2001stereo data
set available at:
\url{http://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/data/scenes2001/}. 
Two of these data comes with ground truth such that you may evaluate the
performance numerically. This should be done by for each image to
compute:
\begin{itemize}
\item The mean disparity error
\item The standard deviation of the disparity error
\item The number and fraction of detected occluded pixels (if detected)
\item The number and fraction of large errors (error $\geq$ 5 pixels).
\end{itemize}

In addition you should describe your subjective evaluation of the
results including comments on where significant or strange errors
occur. Please note that I probably don't see the same as you - explain
to me what I should notice. Good observations and comments may show
more important than good results.  
\medskip

For development you are strongly encuraged to use a few (small and
simple synthetic) stereo images, but results on such data should not
be reported.  


\subsection{What to report}
Your report should include about two pages description of your
solution, the choises that you have made and a summation of your
results. 


For each image pair you should report the numbers described above and
your subjective evaluation. You should also show a gray-coded image of
the computed disparity surface.
\medskip  

In addition your code should be included (Please se first assignment
for the general information on submissions).
